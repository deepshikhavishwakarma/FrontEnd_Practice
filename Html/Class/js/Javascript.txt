JavaScript IT is scripiting language.

variable declaration in js--
1.Let   -- ex--> let name; //decalare the var
               let character="Hello";  //Initialise the variable
               if we reinitialise the var using let then value can be change.
2.var
3.const

JavaScript has seven primitive data types, with String being one of them. In JavaScript, a string represents a sequence of characters and can be enclosed in either single (') or double (") quotes.

Note that strings are immutable, which means once they are created, they cannot be changed. The variable can still be reassigned another value.

Camel case means that the first word in the name is entirely lowercase, but the following words are all title-cased. 
                                  
                                  ----------- Array--------------
An array is a non-primitive data type that can hold a series of values. Non-primitive data types differ from primitive data types in that they can hold more complex data. Primitive data types like strings and numbers can only hold one value at a time.

Arrays are denoted using square brackets ([]). Here is an example of a variable with the value of an empty array:
                         
                          let array = [];


let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
console.log(rows[0]);

Arrays are special in that they are considered mutable. This means you can change the value at an index directly.

For example, this code would assign the number 25 to the second element in the array:
 
                                let array = [1, 2, 3];
                                array[1] = 25;
                                console.log(array); // prints [1, 25, 3]


Notice how the value inside your rows array has been changed directly? This is called mutation.


A method in JavaScript is a function that's associated with certain values or objects. An example you've already encountered is the .log() method, which is part of the console object.

Arrays have their own methods, and the first you will explore is the .push() method. This allows you to "push" a value to the end of an array. Here is an example to add the number 12 to the end of an array:

Example Code
array.push(12);
Use .push() to add the string "freeCodeCamp" to the end of your rows array. 
                  a.push("Deep);
Another method essential for this project is the .pop() method. It removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
